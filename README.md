# Tuna Swarm Optimization

The main inspiration for TSO is based on the cooperative foraging behavior of tuna swarm. The work mimics two foraging behaviors of tuna swarm, including spiral foraging and parabolic foraging, for developing an effective metaheuristic algorithm. The first strategy is spiral foraging. When tuna are feeding, they swim by forming a spiral formation to drive their prey into shallow water where they can be attacked more easily. The second strategy is parabolic foraging. Each tuna swims after the previous individual, forming a parabolic shape to enclose its prey. Tuna successfully forage by the above two methods.
